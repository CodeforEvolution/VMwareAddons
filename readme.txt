VMW Add-ons are a set of tools to enhance the use of Haiku in a VMWare virtual machine.
It currently allows :
 - Clipboard sharing between Haiku and the host OS
 - Mouse sharing : the mouse can seamlessly enter and quit the VM window.

Installation :
1) Drag and drop the "vmvmouse" file in the archive on the folder "Drop vmwmouse here" ;-)
2) Start the "VMWAddOns" application. It will not show any window, but put a small icon into the Deskbar, allowing you to control sharing options. It will automatically restart at each boot.
VMWAddOns can be placed anywhere, but storing in in the "apps" folder of the root folder is usually a good idea.
