VMW Add-ons is a set of tools to enhance interaction between Haiku running in a virtual machine, and the host operating system. 
It's similar to the official VMware Tools on Windows or Linux.

### Features  
 - Clipboard sharing between Haiku and the host OS. Use the VMware add-ons desktop applet to enable or disable the sharing.
 - Mouse sharing: the mouse can seamlessly enter and leave the VM window.
 - Shared folders: easily share files between Haiku and the host OS. The shared folders can be mounted in Haiku using `mount -t vmwfs ~/shared`.
 - Disk compacting: starts the VMware "shrink" process, which reduces the size of "auto-expanding" virtual disks attached to the virtual machine. The free space on disks is cleaned up previously, in order to get better results.
 - Graphics driver for VMware: you can choose your preferred resolution using the Screen preflet in Haiku.
 - Graphics driver for VirtualBox: change the graphics controller in the VM settings to `VMSVGA`, and set the video memory size to 64 MB to be able to use higher resolutions.

### Known bugs and limitations  
 - If you have a volume with more than 800GB of free space, not all free space will be cleaned up on the volume before the shrink process â€” just 800GB.
 - When mouse sharing is activated, the cursor speed and acceleration are defined by the host operating system (setting them in the "Mouse" control panel will have no effect).
